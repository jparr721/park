Python Arguments of Knowledge - A library for expressive zkSNARKs with PLONKish Arithmetization with two big caveats:

1. This is likely _brutally_ slow compared to things like ArkWorks.
2. This is focused entirely on expressiveness and clarity for toy SNARKs.

The goal is for this to be a research-ready platform for quick prototyping, but it will likely take awhile to get there.
