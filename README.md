Python Arguments of Knowledge - A library for expressive zkSNARKs with PLONKish Arithmetization with two big caveats:

1. This is likely _brutally_ slow compared to things like ArkWorks.
2. This is focused entirely on expressiveness and clarity for toy SNARKs and doesn't try to be particularly fast, but I'll speed it up where I can.

The goal is for this to be a research-ready platform for quick prototyping, but it will likely take awhile to get there.
